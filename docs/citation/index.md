## Projects Using the EPOS Platform

Several research infrastructures and data portals across Europe have adopted the EPOS Platform Open Source:

### [EPOS ERIC](http://www.ics-c.epos-eu.org/)

The European Plate Observing System (EPOS) integrates diverse Earth science data from distributed research infrastructures across Europe. The EPOS Platform serves as the primary access point for multidisciplinary solid Earth science datasets.

### [ENVRI-Hub NEXT](https://catalogue.staging.envri.eu/)

ENVRI-Hub provides a comprehensive catalogue of environmental research infrastructure services. The platform enables discovery and access to data and services from various environmental science domains.

### [IPSES](https://prod.ipses-softdth.it:9091/)

The Italian Platform for Seismological and Earth Science data leverages the EPOS Platform Open Source to provide integrated access to geophysical datasets and services for the Italian research community.
