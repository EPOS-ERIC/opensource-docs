# EPOS-DCAT-AP

EPOS-DCAT-AP is a specialized metadata standard integral to the EPOS Open-Source Platform. It is designed to help users organize and make accessible their diverse scientific data and services within the solid-Earth sciences community. By extending the DCAT-AP (Data Catalog Application Profile) specification, EPOS-DCAT-AP provides comprehensive and standardized metadata descriptions, crucial for building a discoverable and interoperable geospatial data catalogue.

## What is EPOS-DCAT-AP?

<!-- TODO: Add a very brief, high-level sentence or two to each characteristic for more context. -->

EPOS-DCAT-AP builds upon the existing DCAT-AP standard, which is a European specification for describing public sector information. It tailors this standard with specific rules and terms relevant to solid-Earth research, enabling a common language for describing diverse resources.

Key characteristics of EPOS-DCAT-AP include:

- **Standardized Description**: Provides a common way to describe datasets, software, and services, improving discoverability and interoperability.
- **Solid-Earth Focus**: Incorporates specific rules and terms tailored for geophysical and geological data.
- **Interoperability**: Designed to facilitate seamless metadata exchange between various systems and organizations.
- **Validation**: Includes mechanisms to validate metadata descriptions, ensuring they adhere to the defined rules.

## Why EPOS-DCAT-AP?

For users deploying the EPOS Open-Source Platform, EPOS-DCAT-AP is the crucial common language that allows you to describe your diverse data and service resources in a consistent and standardized way. This consistency enables your EPOS Platform instance to effectively collect, organize, and make sense of all the metadata, facilitating seamless metadata exchange and ensuring that your geospatial data catalogue is discoverable and interoperable.
