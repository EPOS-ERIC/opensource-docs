# EPOS Platform Opensource

Welcome to the official documentation for the EPOS Platform, an open-source, self-hostable system for integrating and managing geospatial data services.

The EPOS Platform allows you to create a centralized catalogue of web services, making it easy for your users to discover, visualize, and access a wide range of geographic and geophysical data.

## Why Use the EPOS Platform?

- **Unify Your Data Services:** Bring all your distributed data services (like WMS, WFS, and custom APIs) into a single, searchable catalogue. Stop juggling different endpoints and provide a single source of truth for your users.
- **Empower Your Users:** With an intuitive web interface, users can easily search for data, preview it on interactive maps, and access it directly, without needing to be experts in geospatial technology.
- **Stay Flexible and Open:** Built on open standards, the EPOS Platform is designed to be extended. A powerful plugin system allows you to integrate almost any data format, ensuring you're not locked into a proprietary ecosystem.
- **Own Your Infrastructure:** As a self-hostable solution, you have full control over your deployment. Run it on your own servers, in a private cloud, or wherever you need it, ensuring data sovereignty and security.

## Key Features

- **Unified Catalogue:** A central discovery interface for all your geospatial data services.
- **Interactive Visualization:** A web-based platform with interactive maps for data preview.
- **Broad Format Support:** Native support for OGC standards (WMS, WFS) and common formats (GeoJSON, CoverageJSON).
- **Extensible Converters:** A plugin-based architecture to transform custom data formats on the fly.
- **Standardized Metadata:** Uses the EPOS-DCAT-AP standard for rich, searchable service descriptions.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Deploy with Docker or Kubernetes for scalability and easy management.

## About the EPOS Project

The EPOS Platform is the open-source heart of the **European Plate Observing System (EPOS)**, a long-term plan to facilitate the integrated use of data from solid Earth science research infrastructures across Europe. You can learn more about EPOS [here](https://www.epos-eu.org/).
