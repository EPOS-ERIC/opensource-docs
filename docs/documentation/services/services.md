# Services

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the EPOS Platform's technical architecture, explaining how the various components work together to provide a robust geospatial data integration system.

## Overview

EPOS Platform is built as a microservices-based architecture that provides a unified interface for discovering, accessing, and visualizing geospatial data services. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and extensible, allowing organizations to deploy their own geospatial data catalogues.

## Core Components

The EPOS Platform consists of several key components that work together:

### Frontend Services

- **Data Portal**: Web-based user interface for browsing and searching services
- **Backoffice**: Administrative interface for metadata management (in development)

### Backend Services

- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all API requests
- **Resources Service**: Manages service descriptions and catalog information
- **External Access Service**: Handles requests to external geospatial services
- **Converter System**: Transforms data formats for visualization
- **Ingestor Service**: Handles metadata ingestion into the system from `.ttl` files

### Data Layer

TODO

- **Metadata Database**: Stores service descriptions and catalog information
- **Plugin Database**: TODO

### Infrastructure

- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes support

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in EPOS Platform follows this pattern:

## Key Architectural Principles

### Microservices Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through well-defined APIs
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed and scaled independently

### Extensibility

- **Plugin System**: Converter plugins allow support for custom data formats
- **Standards Compliance**: Built on open standards (OGC, DCAT-AP, etc.)
- **API-First Design**: All functionality accessible through REST APIs

### Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be replicated across multiple instances
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across service instances
- **Caching**: Multiple levels of caching for improved performance

## Component Details

For detailed information about specific components:

- **[Converter System](./converter/converter.md)** - Data format conversion and plugin management
- **[Backoffice](./backoffice.md)** - Metadata management interface
- **[Data Model](./data_model.md)** - EPOS data structure and relationships

## Deployment Architecture

EPOS Platform supports multiple deployment patterns:

### Development Environment

- Single-node Docker Compose deployment
- All services running on local machine
- Suitable for development and testing

### Production Environment

- Multi-node Kubernetes deployment
- High availability and load balancing
- Scalable and fault-tolerant

## Security Considerations

The architecture includes several security measures:

TODO

## Monitoring and Observability

TODO
The system provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- **Health Checks**: Service availability monitoring
- **Metrics**: Performance and usage statistics
- **Logging**: Centralized log aggregation
- **Tracing**: Request flow tracking across services

## Future Architecture

TODO
The EPOS Platform architecture is designed to evolve:

- **Backoffice Integration**: Enhanced metadata management capabilities
- **Machine Learning**: Intelligent service discovery and recommendations
